# 📖 Madlibs Story Generator

Welcome to the **Madlibs Story Generator**, a playful Java console application that lets users co-create a story by filling in blanks with their own words. Whether you're aiming for horror or humor, this interactive experience makes storytelling fun and unpredictable.

## ✨ What It Does

- Prompts users to enter creative words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.)
- Dynamically builds a story using those inputs
- Displays a personalized tale with spooky or silly twists

## 🧠 How It Works

The program presents a story template with placeholders like:

```
On a (time of day), we reached the (place) carrying a (object), just as a (sound) rolled through the (location feature)...
```

Users are asked to fill in each blank. Once all inputs are collected, the program constructs and prints a complete story using their responses.

## 🎮 Sample Interaction

```text
Enter time of day: midnight  
Enter place: haunted mansion  
Enter object: lantern  
...

Here's your story:

On a midnight, we reached the haunted mansion carrying a lantern, just as a howl rolled through the foggy hills. Riya tugged my sleeve and whispered, “If we run now, we can avoid the banshee,” but the creaky door swung open by itself...
```

## 💡 Ideas for Expansion

- Add multiple story templates for variety  
- Include random word suggestions for inspiration  
- Save generated stories to a file  
- Build a GUI version using JavaFX or Swing
